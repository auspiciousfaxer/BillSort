As\nsuch, we need to turn to state legislatures to remedy this lack of safety by prohibiting the use of\n\nECT.\n\nAnd for good reason: A pathologist in one inquest said that that the seizure from ECT\ncaused irreparable brain damage.1 In another, a coroner determined that involuntary ECT didn’t\nprevent but /ed to a patient’s suicide. ? In October, 2018, a California court said that a reasonable\njury could find patients suffered brain damage as a result of ECT. The ECT device manufacturer\nsettled the case, avoiding trial, and posted a warning online of the potential for “permanent brain\ndamage” from its device.\n\nSeveral ECT lawsuits alleging brain damage, memory loss or wrongful death have resulted\nin compensation of $1.35 million.\n\nCriminal penalties for administering a damaging treatment also have precedent. In\nAustralia, a drug and electroshock practice called Deep Brain Stimulation was banned in 1983\nafter it killed 48 people, with criminal penalties enacted if administered. This was necessary\nbecause of the complacency of psychiatrists and doctors in allowing this practice to continue for\n20 years—sometimes to children as young as 8.

The majority of school districts in New York have a wellness policy, but these policies\nnormally focus on nutrition issues solely. However, educators know that a healthy school climate promotes a\nhealthy overall school environment and healthier children and get the whole school community involved - school\nadministrators, teachers, staff, parents, and students. Healthier students are better learners, perform better in\nschool, concentrate for longer periods of time, and have lower rates of absenteeism. In this effort, NYMHCA also\nappreciates the need to allow schools districts to uniquely adapt policies to their particular communities’ needs,\nespecially as it relates to mental health services.\n\nFor the above reasons, NYMHCA supports this legislation.\n\nNYMHCA is the advocacy organization representing the clinical mental health counselors of New York State.

At present, potential\nviolators do not feel the need to give space and slow down, as they know the trooper on the\nroadside will likely not get back in vehicle and issue a violation. This mindset is even more\nprevalent when a potential violator sees non-police emergency vehicle on the roadside. With the\nfrequency police officers (the subsect most likely to have a driver “move over” as they can issue\ntickets) are getting struck around the country due to driver failure to comply with this law, it is\nclear this is a larger issue than just having a certain color light on one’s respective emergency\nvehicle. We see tragic cases in which police and emergency responders are needlessly killed by a\nmotorist who is not following the law.\n\nThe statistics show, as does our experience, that there is a tremendous safety risk at present to\nthose responding to the side of the road — the numbers speak for themselves. The rates of\nviolations, as well as roadside accidents, are not declining anymore after their initial decrease\nupon implementation of the law in 2011. Accidents involving these first responders have become\nsteady occurrences in the news cycle. Technology that can effectively issue warnings or tickets\nin real time when a motorist does not move over or slow down is available — and being used in\nother areas to reduce rates of violation. It is past time to implement every tool in our collective\narsenal to avoid further death and destruction.\n\nThe Move Over Law was a worthy and celebrated public policy initiative, and FASNY feels a\ndemonstration program using a move over monitoring system mounted on not just state police\nvehicles, but also the option to operate on any police, fire or emergency vehicle is the logical\nnext step to increase enforcement and begin actually saving the lives of those doing jobs that\nhelp others in their time of need.\n\n',

On behalf of the Petitioners, SPR urges all State Assemblymembers to vote against\nA8410 (Abinanti) (the “Bill”.\n\nThe Bill is the third attempt in the State Assembly this session to halt village\nincorporations and deprive citizens of the right to local self-determination -- see A7997 (Thiele)\nand A8411 (Abinanti), which is nearly identical to the Bill except that it suspends village\nincorporations absolutely, without requiring a town board vote. Although the Bill is drafted to\nmake it appear as if its main purpose is to study incorporation of villages in New York, those\nprovisions are a subterfuge for the Bill’s real goal -- to impose a two-year retroactive moratorium\non village incorporation and thereby block the proposed incorporation of the Village of Seven\nSprings, as well as the proposed incorporations of the Villages of Edgemont and East Quogue.\n\nThere is No Emergency to Justify the Extraordinary\nImposition of a Moratorium on Village Incorporations\n\nThroughout New York State’s history, the State Legislature has very rarely imposed a\nmoratorium and only in the most serious of emergencies. To protect underground water\nsupplies, the State Legislature imposed a temporary state-wide ban on hydrofracking. Another\nexample was in the 1970s when New York City was in imminent danger of defaulting on its\nshort-term debt. A third example was during the Great Depression when the State Legislature\nlimited mortgage foreclosures: There is no crisis facing New York State involving village\nincorporations, and the Bill would set a terrible precedent of enacting a retroactive moratorium\nwhen there is no emergency of any kind to justify such an extraordinary exercise of legislative\npower.. The Bill contains no findings of any emergency warranting imposition of a retroactive\nmoratorium and the deprivation of citizens’ right to vote on the formation of their own village.\n\nThe Retroactive Moratorium on Village\nIncorporations Violates the New York Constitution\n\nThe retroactive moratorium is not only entirely unjustified but also unconstitutional. The\nmoratorium is retroactive to January 1, 2019 and specifically crafted to halt incorporation of\nthree proposed villages: Seven Springs, Edgemont and East Quogue. That is the only reason for\nthe retroactive moratorium. Singling out these three proposed incorporations violates N.Y.\nConst. Art.

This\nlegislation utilizes numerous tools to reduce lead exposure, including the enshrinement of new\nlead-safe standards for rental properties, as well as requiring annual blood lead screenings for\nchildren up until 6 years of age (New York currently only requires screening at age | and 2).\n\nNew York State recently revised its definition of ‘elevated blood lead level’ to 5 micrograms per\ndeciliter (ug/dl), aligning with the level of concern set by the Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC). This bill builds on that accomplishment in multiple ways. First, landlords will\nbe obligated to eliminate lead-based paint and potentially other sources of exposure in their\nrental properties, ensuring that the necessary steps are taken to protect the health of tenants.\n\nSecond, by requiring annual blood lead screenings for children up until 6 years of age, this\nlegislation provides critical protections for families, especially those who move to a lead-unsafe\nrental property with a child over the age of 2. Extended monitoring ensures that if the child is\nexposed to elevated levels of lead, an inspection of the family’s home is triggered and the source\nof lead is eliminated.\n\nNo amount of lead is considered safe in the human body or brain. The growing bodies and\ndeveloping organs of children are especially vulnerable to lead exposure. Even low levels of lead\nin children can cause neurological damage, impaired hearing, slowed growth, and anemia.\n\nAccording to the New York State Children’s Environmental Health Centers, more than 2,200\nchildren in New York are affected by lead poisoning each year. This bill is crucial to combat the\nnegative effects of lead poisoning.\n\nSummary\n\nThis bill amends Section 1370-a and 1373 of the Public Health Law; adds Section 1370-f of the\nPublic Health Law; amends Section 3216, 3221 and 4303 of the Insurance Law; amends Section\n365-a of the Social Services Law; amends Section 14 of the Public Housing Law; and amends\nSection 383 of the Executive Law to expand testing for lead in drinking water to certain day care\nfacilities.\n\nEnvironmental Advocates of New York supports this bill.\n\nMemo #41\n353 Hamilton Street, Albany, New York 12210 - Tel 518.462.5526 + Fax 518.427.0381 - www.eany.org\n\nPrinted on 100% post-consumer recycled paper.\n\n',

Together New York Businesses United for\nProduct Safety collectively employ over 98,000 New Yorkers.\n\nThe legislation would establish a burdensome, unworkable chemical regulatory program. Congress passed bipartisan\ncomprehensive reform legislation to update the regulation of chemicals for the first time in 40 years, modernizing the\nToxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to meet the needs of the 21st Century. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety\nfor the 21st Century Act (LCSA) was signed and enacted into law on June 22, 2016. More effective federal oversight of\nchemicals will give Americans greater confidence that chemicals in commerce are being used safely and reduce the\n\nnumber of inconsistent state-based chemical initiatives that impede interstate commerce and send mixed messages to\nconsumers.\n\nThe undersigned represent leading consumer product, chemical and other manufacturing interests in New York State.\nOver 96% of all manufactured goods are directly touched by the business of chemistry, making New York’s chemical\nmakers an essential part of every facet of our economy. Thanks to chemistry, our lives are healthier, safer, more\nsustainable and productive than before. The chemical manufacturing industry is New York’s largest manufacturing sector,\n\nand represents 9% of total manufacturing employment in New York and 24% of our state’s overall manufacturing\nshipments.\n\nAs manufacturers that supply food, consumer goods and industrial products to the state of New York, we believe that\nassessing product safely is more than simply noting the presence of a chemical substance in a formulation. Consideration\nof product use, user exposure to the chemical in the product, and the functionality of the chemical in the formulation must\nbe included in the legislation.\n\nIn recent years, New York has dropped from Sth to 8th in state chemical production. Unlike other states like North\nCarolina that are seeing production increases, New York has lost more than a quarter of its shipments — dropping from\n$41.5 billion to $30.3 billion.\n\nS.501-B / A.6296-A would only accelerate this decline. These proposals would create a state-level chemicals regulatory\nprogram that would provide a target list of specific chemicals that could result in restrictions or bans in consumer\nproducts, adding to the increasing burdens facing manufacturers in New York State. The legislation does not provide for\nan adequate, scientific, risk-based system of analysis; instead, it appears to identify chemicals of concern based on a\nhazard characterization alone.\n\nFurthermore, we believe that assessing product safety is more than simply noting the presence of a chemical substance in\na formulation. It must also include considerations of product use, user exposure to the chemical in the product, and the\n\nfunctionality of the chemical in the formulation, as well as the unintended consequences of removal of a chemical from a\nproduct. With this proposed legislation lacking such consideration, the process would only add uncertainty for New York\n\nbusinesses and would force companies to comply with yet another state regulatory program among an already crowded\npatchwork of state laws.\n\nInstead of a state-by-state approach, we believe the Federal Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act will ensure that chemicals in\ncommerce are safe for humans and the environment, while protecting the growth and competiveness of businesses.\n\nAccordingly, on behalf of all our memberships, we strongly urge you to support economic growth in New\nYork and oppose S. 501-B / A. 6296-A.\n\n',

In\n2016, the Legislature required public schools to regularly test their tap water for lead and take\naction if elevated levels were discovered. A 2018 analysis of the statewide testing data revealed\nthe shocking prevalence of lead in drinking water: around 82% of school buildings reported one\nor more taps that tested above the state lead action level (15 parts per billion).\n\nIt is time to expand protections against lead in drinking water to day care facilities statewide,\nwhere young children can spend a large proportion of their time.

No matter what. www.PPESacts.org\nPlanned Parenthood Empire State Acts\nMEMORANDUM OF SUPPORT\nA 6325 (Solages)/S 1092-B (Persaud)\n2019\n\nAN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to pelvic examinations on unconscious patients.\n\nUnconsented pelvic exams are not illegal in the state of New York. For example, medical students at a teaching\nhospital can conduct pelvic exams on unconscious patients without their informed consent to the procedure.\nReports indicate that this can happen when a patient is anesthetized for a gynecological procedure unrelated to\na pelvic exam.” While the patient is unconscious, a medical student (or sometimes multiple) is instructed to\npractice administering a pelvic exam on them. The patient may never know they were subjected to an\nunconsented pelvic exam, thus violating the trust and respect of bodily autonomy that is supposed to exist\nbetween a physician and a patient.\n\nAt teaching hospitals, defenders of unconsented pelvic exams argue that the procedure is necessary in the name\nof education. They assert that if individuals were asked for consent beforehand, they would say no, leaving\nstudents without the opportunity to learn and develop a critical skill.2 However, education is not an excuse to\nrob individuals of their right to informed consent. Patients should not be subjected to an unconsented pelvic\nexam if they are in the operating room for a separate procedure. If a patient is anesthetized for brain surgery,\nfor example, the consent to that procedure only applies to the head, and not to other parts of the body.\nProviders must retain the ability to deliver unconsented care only when medically necessary and uphold the\npractice of affirmative consent if the procedure will offer no medical benefit for the patient.\n\nA 6325 (Solages)/S 1092-B (Persaud) would amend the education law to include the performance of\nunconsented pelvic examinations in the code of professional misconduct. Providers, and those supervising\nstudents, could be charged with professional misconduct (with certain exceptions), if found to have\nadministered or supervised the provision of pelvic exams to unconscious patients without their explicit consent.\nExceptions include if prior consent was already given, if a pelvic exam is in line with the expected procedure, and\nif the recipient of the exam is unconscious and a pelvic exam is needed for diagnostic purposes.‘\n\nWhen women were surveyed about the issue of unconsented pelvic exams, the majority said they would\nconsent if they were informed about the procedure beforehand.° This finding rejects the assertion that asking\nfor consent would jeopardize educational opportunities for medical students. Unconsented pelvic exams are a\nviolation of consent and bodily autonomy, widely unnecessary, and they normalize toxic behavior that displays\nwomen’s bodies as open for unconsented invasion. The practice of unconsented pelvic exams is outlawed in\nHawaii, California, Illinois, Virginia, Utah, and Oregon, but it is still legal in the 44 remaining states, despite\nwidespread condemnation of the practice.® New York needs to join other forward-thinking states and curtail this\ndeeply problematic practice.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Empire State Acts strongly urges the legislature to pass this crucial bill.\n\n1 Eisenberg, A.

The bill, known as “less is more,” dramatically\nchanges the current law as it relates to community supervision. As written, the bill would\nmake it virtually impossible for parole officers to do their jobs. The proposal removes all\nmeaningful consequences for bad actors, ties the hands of parole officers and makes it\nmuch harder for them to help parolees transition back into society. With the number of\nviolent crimes on law enforcement personnel on the rise, the timing of this proposal could\n\nnot be worse.\n\nThe legislation relies on the faulty premise that our jails and prisons are full of parolees\nsent back by overzealous parole officers because they were fifteen minutes late for curfew.\nIn fact, less than 2 percent of the inmates at Rikers Island are true technical parole\nviolators. The other 18 percent of the population considered parole violators are\nobsconders, who are actually fugitives whose whereabouts had previously been unknown.\nThe bill sponsors wrongfully assume that parole officers’ principle goal is to lock people\nup instead of focusing on all of the things that they do to help parolees safely reintegrate\nback into the community.\n\nThe bill takes the fundamental terms and conditions of parole, which is essentially a\n\ncontract between the parole officer and the parolee with expectations, rules and\nconsequences, and wipes out the consequences. As written, parole officers no longer have\n\nthe ability to re-incarcerate parolees for violating essentially any of the terms and\nconditions of their release.

Based on the uncertainty with respect to\nthe amount and timing of payment it is not productive for either the customer or the contractor to predicate\nthe transaction on future receipt of funds which may not materialize. This approach is equivalent to\ncontracting for home construction and starting work before there is a commitment for a construction loan\nfrom the lending institution as to the amount and payment of the same.\n\nThis approach would eliminate the necessity for the cancellation provision, which permits the customer to\nnullify the contract if the insurance proceeds are not forthcoming. This provision is not positive for the\nconsumer because even if the contract ends the residence may be in a state of semi-repair where the work\nwas started. The contractor risks both loss of payment for the work undertaken as it applies to both labor\nand materials. The homeowner has a cancelled contract, where the job is undone.\n\nWe believe that a consumer should not contract for a project where there are not sufficient funds available\nto the consumer to pay for the project. The contractor should not be using contingent insurance funding as\nan inducement to undertake a project which is not otherwise financially feasible. This approach indicates,\nin many cases, that the contractor is not interested in completion of the work and that a potential scam is\nbeing initiated.\n\nMost other provisions in the bill are unnecessary because they are either dealt with in the contract or\npursuant to the current Home Improvement Contract Law, which is applicable to the roofing contractors.\n\nThe Home Improvement Contract law provides two pathways for contractors to perform - on a time and\nmaterials basis or progress payments. The statute requires progress payments to show the amount of\npayments and identify the state of completion when the payment is due. The contractor is required to place\nfunds in an escrow account or other prescribed method to protect the consumer's funds.\n\nThis bill provides that the contractor cannot require a deposit of more than half of the agreed-upon\nconsideration.

This\nimportant bill will provide plant-based options to students in public schools.\n\nResearch shows that plant-based diets—which are high in fiber, nutrients, and vitamins\nand low in saturated fat and cholesterol—can help prevent and treat diet-related\ndisease.\n\nHeart disease has long been the number one cause of death in New York and is\npredominantly the result of diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol. Other chronic\ndiseases, such as diabetes and cancer, also place a huge burden on the state’s\neconomy and public health resources. Plant-based diets reduce the risk of heart\ndisease, kidney disease, obesity, and several types of cancers.\n\nMore and more children are being diagnosed in New York with type 2 diabetes.\nAccording to the 2015 report, “Diabetes in New York State,” prepared by the Office of\nthe State Comptroller, about 10 percent of adults in New York have been diagnosed\nwith diabetes. And 95 percent of New Yorkers with diabetes have type 2, which is\nusually caused by poor diet. New York currently spends approximately $22 billion per\nyear treating diabetes. Much of this expense is due to the skyrocketing costs of insulin,\nthe frontline medical treatment for diabetes. However, lifestyle changes, including a\nplant-based diet, can greatly improve the body’s ability to regulate glucose levels,\nthereby lowering or eliminating the need for insulin in the first place.\n\nThis bill will give the public school system the opportunity to help young New Yorkers\nmake responsible choices for their nutrition, especially as the broader food environment\noften discourages good dietary behaviors. Ensuring that students have access to\nhealthy plant-based meals helps reduce their future risk of very expensive diet-related\nillness. $1472 (Hoylman) / A1624 (Gottfried) is a simple yet important measure that will\nlead to improved health outcomes for New York’s future voters. For these reasons, the\nPhysicians Committee strongly urges support for $1472 (Hoylman) / A1624\n(Gottfried).\n\n',

We respectfully request that a percentage of revenue generated from the legalization of\nmarijuana be dedicated to afterschool programs.\n\nIn its current form, the Act would "develop and implement a youth-focused public health\neducation and prevention campaign, including school-based prevention..." Afterschool\nprograms, especially those located in high-need districts with at-risk children and youth, are\nwell-positioned to provide a forum for this campaign. A survey of our member organizations\nearlier this year showed that many already provide a drug abuse prevention curriculum and are\neager to ramp up those efforts.\n\nThe Act would also establish a "NYS community grants reinvestment fund" with funds going to\n"qualified community-based nonprofit organizations". With a fund steering committee\ncomprised of agencies including the NYS Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) and the\nNYS Education Department (NYSED), we see this as another opportunity for afterschool\nprograms. We urge you to include language explicitly about afterschool programs so that they\ndo not get lost in larger discussions.\n\nNew York State currently serves 16,000 children and youth through the Advantage After School\nProgram and 35,000 through the Empire State After-School Program. These programs provide a\nsafe, supervised space for children from the hours of 3:00 — 6:00. Programs are proven to:\ndecrease drug use; build resilience; improve health outcomes and academic achievement; and\nreduce crime. Programs are most important for those at-risk, including racial minorities,\nchildren of incarcerated parents, and immigrants.\n\nResearch shows that if children and youth have a strong foundation, they are less likely to\nengage in risky behaviors. Therefore, we believe that afterschool and summer programs are the\nideal venue to not only educate children and youth about the dangers of drug abuse, but\n(perhaps more importantly) to provide and strengthen the Protective Factors that have been\nshown to decrease drug use.\n\nAs defined by the Center for the Study of Social Policy, there are five Protective Factors:\n\n',

For Easter Sunday, | recall\nshopping for that special Lego or K'nex toy that challenged our son, Ben, and that he wanted so badly. From a\nyoung age, he had a talent for quickly assembling these toys. He also had a very caring and loving personality.\n\nThen came the tumultuous teenage years and the summer when Ben began suffering from severe depression.\nHe did not tell us what was happening to him because he was afraid he would end up ina psychiatric hospital\nand be humiliated at school. While in a state of psychosis, he lit a fire in an empty house and was subsequently\narrested. Even though he was an honor student and a Boy Scout and had never been in any type of trouble, he\nwas sent to prison at the age of 17.\n\nWhile at Woodbourne Correctional Facility, Ben obtained his GED and was named valedictorian. At the age of\n18, he was accepted into the highly competitive Bard Prison Initiative, where he took college courses. Each\nyear we spent the holidays with him, eating vending machine food and playing card games.\n\nBut for Ben, there were more bad times than good times.\n\nBen told us he was subjected to sexual abuse by another incarcerated person and was assaulted by prison\nstaff. He began suffering from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. It all came to a head when he was\nwrongly accused of fighting, in retaliation for complaining about staff mistreatment. He was put in solitary\nconfinement, locked in a tiny cell for 23 hours a day and only allowed out for an hour of so-called recreation,\nalone in a different cage. There, he had minimal access to mental health treatment and was not allowed to\nattend any programs. Before, we had talked on the phone just about every day, but people in solitary are not\nallowed to make phone calls. Ben was completely alone.\n\nBen could no longer endure the violence, brutality, inhumanity and loneliness of prison life. He had experienced\nand witnessed too many horrible events. On Oct. 30, 2014, while in solitary confinement, Ben hanged himself.\n\nHe was 21 years old.\n\nOur grief is immeasurable, and we have dealt with it in many ways. Most important to us was preventing this\ntragedy from befalling anyone else. We built a replica solitary confinement cell and joined other advocates in\nraising awareness across the state while fighting to pass the Humane Alternatives to Long-Term Solitary\nConfinement Act (A2500/S1623).\n\nIf HALT had been law, Ben would still be alive today. HALT prohibits the placement of people like Ben, with\nmental illness, in solitary confinement. Also, it would restrict placement in solitary to more serious misconduct,\nso he would not have been sent to solitary for a minor rule violation and with no due process.\n\nIn some cases, a person may need to be isolated, and HALT would limit that to 15 days, in line with\n\ninternational human rights standards. If the person continues to pose a serious threat, they could be\ntransferred to therapeutic units with the goal of addressing the underlying cause of any problematic behavior,\n\nincluding by ensuring access to meaningful, pro-social programming.\n\nNow, after a long, hard campaign, the bill has enough support to pass in both houses of the Legislature. We\ndemand that they bring it to the floor and pass it — without weakening it — this year, and that the governor\n\nsign it as is.\n\nNew York's leaders are responsible for our son's death, and they alone can end the abhorrent use of\nincarceration to respond to mental illness, and the torture of solitary confinement.\n\n",

Strengthening renters’ rights is critical to strong\nneighborhoods, educational and health outcomes, and economic\nstability for all New Yorkers.\n\nThe “Housing Justice for All” platform would do three primary things:\n\n1. Close the loopholes in the current rent laws for 2.5 million rent-\nregulated tenants by ending vacancy decontrol and the vacancy bonus;\neliminating major capital improvement increases and individual\napartment improvement increases; and making preferential rents the\nlegal rent for the life of the tenancy.\n\n2. Grant the right to opt-into the rent stabilization system to every\nmunicipality in New York State.\n\n3. Give all tenants in the state -- except for those in owner-occupied\nbuildings with fewer than four units -- the basic right to a renewal lease\nwith a limited rent increase.\n\nThese are simple fixes. Many of them were previously the law in New\nYork State before Republicans weakened the rent laws about 20 years\nago.

This law requires public employers to develop a workplace violence\nprevention program to protect employees from potentially violent encounters. When the 2006 law\nwas enacted, public schools were excluded from the employers required to develop such programs.\n\nThis bill would remove the exemption for public schools. According to the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, the rate of violent incidents among school employees was almost twice the rate of all\nother workers. This bill would address this issue by requiring schools to initiate a violence\nprotection program, which would include a risk evaluation to determine if the worksite might place\nemployees at risk of violence and a follow-up procedure to take corrective action. Further, this bill\nwould not only protect employees, but would also create a safer environment for students to grow\n\nand learn.\n\nAll workers deserve to go to work without having to fear that they will face violence.

This legislation also authorizes any public employee or representative of public employees who\nbelieves that a serious violation of a safety or health standard or an imminent danger exists, to request an inspection by the\n\nDepartment of Labor.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SUPPORT:\n\nChapter 82 of the Laws of 2006 established a statutory requirement that public employers develop and implement\nprograms to prevent workplace violence. School districts were exempted under that statute in order to ascertain whether\nor not similar requirements already existed under current law. After a thorough review, it was determined that it is\nnecessary and appropriate to include school districts under the provisions of this law for various reasons.\n\nSadly, violence in school settings is an increasingly visible element in our state’s education system and too many school\nfacilities contain real and persistent hazards to the health and safety of teachers, school-related professionals and students.\nThis legislation would assist school districts in identifying and mitigating potential safety problems in order to ensure a\nsafe work and learning environment for all of their employees and the students they serve.\n\nIt has been argued that the SAVE legislation provides schools with the necessary guidelines and provisions to address\nviolence in schools. However, NYSUT contends that while the SAVE legislation does address school violence issues, it\naddresses them in a reactionary manner, whereas this legislation seeks to address them proactively by preventing school\n\nviolence issues (see chart). Specifically, this legislation:\n\ne requires employers to work with unions to evaluate the workplace and identify risks of violence. Employers\nthen must implement strategies to reduce or eliminate those risks in order to ensure a safe work and learning\n\nenvironment for all of their employees and students;\n\ne requires that public school districts develop and implement a written workplace violence prevention program;\n\ne requires that school staff receive training on strategies to protect themselves from the violence or other\ndangerous situations in the workplace. Training needs are based on the workplace evaluation;\n\ne requires violence reporting systems to be used to track incidences of violent or aggressive behavior in an\neffort to identify trends or patterns that require remediation; and .\n\n¢ authorizes any public employee or a representative of such public employee who believes that a serious —___\n\n_ S\n\n—\n\n',

This would allow the school district to save and then\nmake expenditures from this reserve fund for any loss, claim, action or judgment directly related to\nthe district’s self-insured plan.

In fact, the\nStatue of Liberty in New York harbor has long served as a symbol of welcome for new Americans. The\nstate has long advanced policies that promote the health and wellbeing of all New Yorkers—including\nour immigrant communities. In many parts of the state, driving is the only way to access health care,\nsocial services, and other necessities. When our communities are healthy, the entire state benefits,\nand this legislation is a positive step toward a healthier and safer New York.\n\nGreen Light NY would enable the 752,000 New Yorkers over the age of 16 who are currently ineligible\nfor drivers’ licenses because of their immigration status to access a “standard” state license. Without a\nlicense, one cannot register or insure a vehicle, or, in much of the state, carry valid photo\nidentification. Without insurance or a license, individuals may delay seeking needed medical care and\nmay avoid preventive care entirely. Access to transportation is vital in keeping all New Yorkers healthy.\nIn much of the state, driving is a necessity — not a privilege. Allowing everyone to access a driver’s\nlicense, regardless of immigration status, would also lower the rate of uninsured drivers in the state.\nWhen New Mexico adopted this policy in 2003, its rate of uninsured drivers dropped from 33% to 9%.1\n\nThis policy offers additional financial benefits. Research estimates that expanding eligibility for a\nstandard license will lead to a one-time revenue surge of $26 million to state and county governments,\nfollowed by an annual increase in revenue of $57 million. It is estimated that this will also lower\ninsurance premiums across the state by about $17 per person per year, as the pool of insured drivers\n\nexpands.’\n\nIn 2017, New York announced its plan to be REAL ID compliant by October 2020. This proposal\nincluded three tiers of license, Enhanced, Real and Standard. The addition of a standard license that is\nclearly marked as not for federal purposes presents the perfect opportunity to advance the Greenlight\nLegislation. Making this standard license available to New Yorkers of all immigration statuses will make\nour roads and communities healthier.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Empire State Acts urges legislators to support this important initiative.\n\n1 Project Green Light: Driving Together fact sheet.\n2 Ibid.\n\n",

Denying people the ability to get a driver’s license\ndenies them the chance to participate equally in everyday life.\nPeople who pass all the necessary driving tests shouldn’t be denied\na license just because of their immigration status.\n\nMaking driver’s licenses available to more New Yorkers is good\nfor public safety.

The attorneys and their firms who make up the Bar\nAssociation run professional practices that operate under an ethical framework promulgated by the\njudiciary in search of durable and equitable debt resolutions. NYSCBA strongly opposes the above\ncaptioned legislation.\n\nThis bill creates a private right of action against someone who collects a debt improperly. Violators\nwould be liable to a debtor for actual damages, punitive damages, and reasonable attorney’s fees. This\nright of action is in addition to any action taken by the District Attorney or the Attorney General.\n\nWhile NYSCBA supports efforts to increase transparency and combat consumer harm, our members call\nfor a balanced approach to further debt collection regulation. Existing laws and regulation such as the\nFair Debt Collection Practices Act have successfully addressed consumer harm resulting from collection\nabuses and bad actors. In addition, NYSCBA members have collectively invested millions of dollars in\ncompliance systems to ensure appropriate collection practices.\n\nThis bill represents a one-sided approach to debt collection regulation that will have unintended\nnegative consequences. An overly punitive private right of action will ultimately harm consumers by\nleaving law-abiding collectors with far less resources to support internal compliance while paying hefty\nlegal fees to a “cottage industry” of “professional plaintiffs” over perceived technical violations. Further,\nthis bill does not provide detail necessary to administer such a law, for example, a statute of limitations,\na legal standard of review to impose liability, or provisions addressing technical violations. The bill is also\nabsent any right to cure alleged violations without which a cottage industry, as has been experienced on\nthe federal level, will inevitably be created serving no benefit to the consumer which has been discussed\nby numerous federal judges. This will start a vicious cycle that will put New York firms out of business\nand cost consumers the availability of credit.\n\nNYSCBA therefore strongly opposes this legislation, and urges members to oppose this bill.\n\n',

Prevailing wages allow construction workers to gainfully support\nthemselves and their families, without the struggle of living pay check to pay check. This wage\nrequirement applies to public work and has helped uplift countless New Yorkers. However, in\nrecent years it has become increasingly difficult for the New York State Department of Labor to\ndefine public work and therefore apply the proper wage scale for workers on these projects.\n\nThe New York State Department of Labor currently has a three-pronged approach to figuring out\nif a project is in fact public work, but this rudimentary system largely excludes the role public\nfunding plays in these developments. Often, developers are receiving public funding for these\nprojects but aren’t subject to the proper wage scale for their workforce because of the ambiguity\nthat exists within the law. Meaning developers and contractors that receive significant public\nfunding, our tax dollars, are not required to pay workers fair, area standard wages and benefits,\nwhich breeds an underground economy of exploitive labor practices and out of state, underpaid\nworkers.\n\nA1261/S1947 will eliminate ambiguities in the law and create a clear definition of public work,\nthus making sure New York’s workers are receiving the proper wages and benefits for their work\non these projects that will largely benefit the public.

For a variety of reasons this did not\noccur.\n\nIt is now imperative with less than 50 days left in the session to pass A1261/S1947.\n\nIn the waning days of the budget session, there were requests from some Senators for documents,\nstudies, and news articles related to public works. Enclosed in this box is a voluminous amount\nof information that will debunk misinformation being spread and expedite the process around\nthis legislation.\n\nWhile you have already received much of this material and heard a great deal about\nA1261/S1947 through our countless actions in Albany with thousands of activists and day\nlaborers, we wanted to be sure you were equipped with all the information once again to dispel a\nnumber of myths around that legislation that continue to rear their head. More specifically, this\nbox includes economic and academic studies from the Economic Policy Institute and the Cornell\nUniversity School of Industrial and Labor Relations to help you dismiss misinformation about\nthe cost implications of prevailing wages and construction workforce diversity being spread by\nopponents of the legislation. It also includes news articles and op-eds that demonstrate the\nbreadth of support for this legislation both upstate and down.\n\nWith June 19 fast approaching, it is imperative you recognize the facts and disregard the\nmisinformation and falsities meant to keep workers from earning the wages they deserve.\n\nTime is running out for our elected leaders to ensure New York is on the side of workers and\ntaxpayers. With A1261/S1947, New York will finally be able to balance the disbursement of\npublic dollars with greater fiscal responsibility to the very people that build our state and pay the\ntaxes that make it possible to dole out vast sums of money. You must push back against elements\nwith questionable ties to billionaire developers who push the illogical narrative that the best way\nto help workers of color is to NOT raise their wages.\n\nOn behalf of LiUNA-NY’s combined 40,000 members and over 1,500 signatory contractors, we\nask that meet your obligation and commitment to pass legislation that will raise wages for all\nconstruction workers, Union and Non-Union and to ignore the distractions and diversions created\nby its opponents.\n\n',

 ('\n\x0c- New York State\n\nLECET\n\nMEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT\n\nLegislation A1261 (Bronson)/S1947(Ramos)\n\nTitle Relates to hours, wages and supplements in contracts for public work\n\nNew York State Laborers Employment Cooperation and Education Trust (NYS LECET) is a labor\nmanagement organization representing over 40,000 members, twenty- four local unions and a number of\naffiliated contractors. NYS LECET aggressively advocates for wage and safety standards for our\nmembers, raising the floor for both union and nonunion construction workers.\n\nNew York State LECET STRONGLY SUPPORTS A1261/S1947, legislation clearly defining public\nwork.\n\nNew York has historically led the nation in advancing the rights of workers, consistently ensuring fair\nwages and benefits are paid to the state’s workforce. These workplace protections extend to New York’s\nConstitution, where the requirement for employers to pay prevailing wages on public works projects is\nenshrined. Prevailing wages ensure workers receive a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work, and prevents\nemployers from exploiting their workforce.\n\nAmbiguities in the statute have emerged over the years, creating confusion over what projects are deemed\npublic work, and if employers can be compelled to pay the prevailing wage. The New York State\nDepartment of Labor currently uses a flawed three pronged test to determine what projects can be deemed\npublic work. As part of this test, distinguishing if a project is paid for in whole or in part by public funds\nis only one component in determining if a project can be classified as public work. Often times, this\nallows employers to receive significant subsidy from the state with no obligation to pay their workforce\nthe prevailing wage. Court cases in recent years have eroded what has traditionally been considered\npublic work, creating an environment where workers can be exploited and paid poverty level with wages.\n\nA1261/S1947 eliminates any uncertainty in the current statute by providing a clear definition of public\nwork. A clear definition of public work guarantees workers receive the prevailing wages they deserve on\npublic projects. The legislation does so by creating a bright line test that contemplates two major\ncomponents of the project: if the construction is paid for in whole or part by public funds and if the\nconstruction is performed in contemplation of a public entity leasing a portion of the space in the\nresulting development. This test is a fair representation of what can be considered public work and\nprovides clear guidelines to the New York State Department of Labor and employers in determining\nwhether or not prevailing wages need to be paid. Currently, the New York State Department of Labor is\nsaddled with making painstaking, and often arbitrary decisions over whether or not a project can be\nconsidered public work. A01261/S01947 assists the Department of Labor by eliminating any ambiguity.\nAdditionally, this legislation provides New York State Department with stronger enforcement\nmechanisms to prevent unscrupulous employers from skirting the law.\n\nThis legislation will create a more fair and equitable New York. With passage of this legislation New\n\nYork State is sending a clear message; public subsidies come with public responsibilities. New York State\nLECET STRONGLY SUPPORTS A01261/S01947.\n\n',

Terry Melvin\nPresident, Coalition of Black Trade Unionists\n\nThe Coalition of Black Trade Unionists has long been a progressive voice within the American labor\nmovement, advocating for the fair and just treatment of black workers across sectors. CBTU is\nunrelenting and unapologetic in our mission to ensure the labor movement is responsive to the needs\nof black workers. We also work tirelessly to raise the floor for all black workers, whether union or\nnonunion. Therefore, our support for A1261/ $1947, legislation clearly defining public work, should\ncome as no surprise to those who know us and are aware of the ideals that guide us.\n\nThe public works legislation pending before the New York State Legislature is clearly in line with the\nmission statement of CBTU. Requiring prevailing wages be paid to construction workers on publicly\nsubsidized projects is a commonsense solution that addresses an epidemic in New York State. New\nYork has for too long been in the business of dispersing public funds to create poverty-level jobs that\ndo nothing to uplift communities of color. This bill will create a pipeline for black workers to have\n\ngreater economic opportunities, including the potential to earn the prevailing wages and benefits they\ndeserve and have long been denied.\n\nThe public works bill will benefit black men and women working in the construction industry in a\nmultitude of ways. Although the legislation is not a union mandate, it creates increased opportunities\nfor black workers to earn higher wages, and in some cases join a union. A 2017 Economic Policy\nInstitute study highlighted the benefits unions provide to black workers, citing black workers in the\nunionized sector make on average $5 more an hour than their nonunion counterparts. Additionally,\nblack workers are chronically underrepresented in the nonunion construction sector, representing\nonly 18.8 percent of the total workforce, compared to 21.2 percent in the unionized construction\nworkforce. Moreover, construction unions are continuing to make strides, nearly doubling the number\nof black apprentices in their training programs over the past twenty years. The public works bill will\nserve to further increase opportunities for black men and women in accessing higher paying jobs in\nthe construction industry, as well as in the unionized construction trades.\n\nProviding a comprehensive definition of public work is critical in creating greater economic mobility for\n\nblack workers. We call on the legislature to pass A1261/ $1947 promptly. Our communities have\nwaited too long for the wages and job opportunities they deserve.\n\n',

PFAS are found\nin fast food packaging, beverage containers, microwaveable popcorn bags, bakery and deli\npapers, grocery store take-out containers, and in other food packaging. PFAS are very persistent\nin the environment and in the human body, meaning they don’t break down and bioaccumulate\nover time. PFAS can transfer from toxic packaging to the foods and beverages we consume,\nleading to dangerous exposure. :\n\nPFAS persist beyond the useful life of the packaging, thus contaminating landfill leachate (liquid\ndrained from landfills and sent to wastewater treatment facilities) and eventually making their\nway into our waterways. Samples taken from landfill leachate in Hoosick Falls, NY had PFAS\nlevels of up to 21,000 parts per trillion (ppt) and surface water samples taken near the landfill\nhad levels as high as 1,900 ppt. In comparison, the EPA health advisory level for PFAS is 70 ppt.\nExposure to PFAS can lead to higher rates of kidney and testicular cancer, higher cholesterol\nlevels, suppressed immune system, thyroid problems, and adverse developmental effects and\ndecreased immune response in children.\n\nScientific studies show that food packaging is one of the most common ways people are exposed\nto PFAS. The Center for Environmental Health found PFAS in 100% of microwave popcorn\nbags and molded food service-ware tested. A study by the Silent Spring Institute found PFAS in\none-third of fast food packaging. Currently there are no state or federal regulations on the use of\nshort-chain PFAS in food packaging, and there is no way for consumers to know if our food is\npackaged using PFAS. The only way to ensure PFAS are not contaminating our foods and\nbeverages is to ban their use in food packaging.\n\nThis bill would ban the entire class of PFAS chemicals from food packaging containers used in\nNew York. Washington State signed similar legislation into law in April 2018. In order to protect\nthe health and safety of New Yorkers, we must take an aggressive approach by prohibiting the\nuse of all PFAS chemicals in food packages.\n\nCITIZENS CAMPAIGN FOR THE ENVIRONMENT SUPPORTS\n~ A.4739/S.2000 — BAN PFAS IN FOOD PACKAGING\n\nCCE is an 80,000 member non-profit, non-partisan advocacy organization that works to empower communities and\nadvocate solutions that protect public health and the natural environment\n\nArnril 1 9N10\n\n— 2\n\n',

In so doing, the CPSA would reduce women’s reproductive\ncapabilities to the status of a contracted service and treat children as consumer goods.\n\nThe sponsors of the CPSA propose to legalize compensated surrogate parenting contracts and\ncreate aconfusing and deeply problematic legal framework for parenthood. The CPSA’s other major\nflaws include its absurd and dishonest name and its stubborn insistence upon placing the\npreferences of adults at a higher priority than the needs of vulnerable children.\n\nWhile the CPSA will no doubt appeal to the small number of affluent New Yorkers who seek to rent\nwomen’s wombs, and while the bill would most certainly provide new and novel opportunities for\nattorneys who practice family law, legislators should consider only one question when determining\ntheir stances on this bill. That question is: Would children in the State of New York be better off if\nthe CPSA became law? Because the answer is clearly “no,” the CPSA must be defeated.\n\n1. The CPSA is unnecessary.\n\nIn July of 1992, then-Governor Mario Cuomo signed legislation banning compensated surrogate\nparenting contracts in the State of New York. The legislation signed by Gov. Cuomo added a new\nArticle Eight to the Domestic Relations Law, and stated that “[s]urrogate parenting contracts are\nhereby declared contrary to the public policy of this state, and are void and unenforceable.” The\nexisting policy makes sense, as it guards against the commercialization of reproduction and\nparenting. However, the CPSA proposes to reverse this policy by allowing paid surrogacy\nagreements.

If such an amendment were to\npass, legislative and executive authority would be handed over to the judiciary to define such terms;\nthereby, shifting policymaking to the judicial branch and raising separation of powers concerns.\nAdditionally, the proposal fails to establish which cause of action can be asserted and against whom, or\nwhat remedies are available. The broad nature of this measure creates uncertainty and may result in\narbitrary enforcement that could hold up countless public and private projects; thus, harming the citizens\nit seeks to protect by driving up costs and stifling economic opportunities.\n\nAdirect right of action under the constitution provides no additional environmental safeguards and would\nonly burden the court system. New York’s Constitution already contains a Conservation Bill of Rights that\nserves to highlight the importance of environmental conservation and stewardship.

Divestment from coal companies must be completed within one year,\nand within 5 years from all other fossil fuel companies. Currently about $6 billion in public pension\nmoney is invested in companies that mine, drill and/or produce fossil fuels.\n\nSchool by school, we have been passing fossil fuel divestment and reinvestment resolutions so that\n\nCUNY's Board of Trustees recognize the popular support for divestment and responsible policies\n\nregarding climate change. As future leaders in New York City, the City University of New York\n\n(CUNY) Community has committed to renewable energy for our future and our livelihoods. We\n\nrecognize that our communities will be hit hardest with climate change, and we are committed to\n\ninsisting that our University, City and State begin divestment from companies committed to\nirresponsible and toxic energy choices.\n\nWe are proud to say government bodies of the following schools and institutions have passed\nresolutions in support of our campaign goals:\n\n1.

Experts tell us, and the nations of the world agree, that a temperature rise of 1.5\ncentigrade will cause irreversible damage to the world’s ecosystems and result in profound human\nsuffering. If we were to burn all of the fossil fuels currently listed in the inventories of the world’s\nfossil fuel companies, we would far exceed the 1.5-degree limit. The only rational course for humanity\nis to leave fossil fuel that has already been discovered in the ground and to rapidly shift from reliance\non fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.\n\nFossil fuel companies and their investors, driven by profit motives, have lobbied for the unfettered\nright to continue to produce energy sources that release greenhouse gases and accelerate planetary\ntemperature rise. We believe it is unwise for institutional investors to participate in this. We want the\nState Comptroller to divest the NY State Common Retirement Fund from the two hundred most\ndestructive fossil fuel companies, and we support the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act, which would require\n\nhim to do so.\n\nIn addition to the moral grounds for divestment, which we believe are sufficient to support this bill, we\nalso note that a step of this magnitude will draw significant attention to the urgency of climate change.\nThis is especially important now, when much of the leadership of our country is aligned with\nprofiteers who deny that climate change is real. If New York State divests, it will raise the\nconsciousness of millions of Americans, it will be a strong counter to the disinformation that is\ncurrently being promulgated, and it will set an example that other states will follow.\n\nFinally, we favor divestment for financial reasons. As conditions worsen and awareness of climate\nchange increases, it is inevitable that governments throughout the world will issue rules and\nregulations that will inhibit the production of fossil fuels. In addition, the international community is\nalready taking voluntary steps on a massive scale to reduce its carbon footprint, including shifts in\nbuilding practices, energy efficiencies, transportation systems, and individual behaviors. Sooner or\nlater, these trends will bring down the value of fossil fuel companies, perhaps precipitously. This has\nalready happened in the coal industry. Wise investors avoid volatility and significant risk, and that is\nexactly what the fossil fuel industry represents today.\n\nWe urge the New York Senate and Assembly to take leadership in what we believe to be the biggest\n\nmoral issue of our time. Please approve the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act for the sake of New Yorkers,\nliving and unborn, and the future of our planet and humanity.\n\n',

Currently about $13 billion in public pension money in our state is invested in companies that\nmine, drill and/or produce fossil fuels.\n\nGlobal warming is reaching crisis proportions, creating havoc to the climate. Climate events such as\nSuperstorm Sandy and Hurricane Irene have already harmed countless New Yorkers, including in the\nNew York City metro region, Long Island, Central New York and the Southern Tier. New York will face in\nthe future massive population dislocation due to rising sea levels, food shortages from dying oceans,\nagricultural disruption, and economic devastation to communities around the state. If there is any hope\nin limiting the worst climate impacts, the world must aggressively transition to renewable energy.\n\nNew York and other states must take the lead in fighting global warming. Divestment is a winning\nstrategy to combat climate change: it played a role in the end of apartheid in South Africa. Already, over\n700 institutions throughout the world -- including governments, schools, religious institutions and\nindividuals -- have pledged to divest more than $5 trillion from the fossil fuel industry.\n\nIt is also fiscally irresponsible to invest in fossil fuels. In the last few years, the decision not to divest\nhas cost the fund billions of dollars, according to successive studies by Corporate Knights, an investment\nresearch company. As the world economy moves rapidly toward a renewable energy future, continued\nfossil fuel development will lead to stranded assets, and the significant devaluation of fossil fuel stocks.\n\nCitizen Action therefore strong urges enactment of the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act this year.

NRDC has more than three million members and\nonline activists around the world, including more than 215,000 in New York State.

These 200\ncompanies are to be identified based on the carbon content of their oil, gas and coal reserves.\nWithin five years—and one year for companies invested in coal—the Comptroller must\ncompletely divest from these companies whether the fund holds the assets directly or through\nseparate accounts or comingled state pension funds. The bill, however, also allows the\nComptroller to stop divesting, continue investing, or begin reinvesting, in these fossil fuel\ncompanies if “clear and convincing evidence” shows that the State Retirement Fund has lost or\nwould lose at least half a percent of the fund’s total worth.\n\nStatement in Support:\n\nCurrent global fossil fuel reserves, if extracted and bumed, would exceed—many times\nover—the international carbon budget for a worldwide average increase in temperatures by 1.5\nor 2°C. One global response to this climate crisis is to push large institutions to stop investment\nin fossil fuel companies.\n\nNRDC supports divestment as part of a broad climate strategy to pressure companies\nfrom continuing to invest in fossil fuel extraction and infrastructure. For this reason, some large-\nscale investors like New York City and the Republic of Ireland have committed to divesting\nfrom fossil fuels. And as of the end of 2018, more than 1,000 institutional investors globally had\ncommitted to divest almost $8 trillion in holdings from fossil fuels.\n\nWe also believe that divestment could likely have economic benefits for New York State\nand other investors over the long-term.

Inc. is a state-wide labor union consisting of more than 216 member local PBAs representing\nmore than 25,000 police officers throughout the State of New York. We write in opposition to this proposed legislation to amend\nthe Retirement and Social Security Law to require the Comptroller of the State of New York to divest the funds under his control\nfrom the stocks of any of the 200 largest publicly traded fossil fuel companies as an unlawful impairment and diminution of the\nbenefits of membership in the New York State Retirement System and an unlawful incursion on the sanctity of the Comptroller’s\nindependence and autonomy over the funds of the Retirement System.\n\nArticle V, Section 7 of the New York State Constitution prohibits any diminution or impairment of the benefits of membership in\nthe New York State Retirement System. New York Law is clear that any attempt by the legislature to direct the Comptroller in his\ninvestment of the funds of the New York State Retirement System under his control violates Article V, Section 7 of the State\nConstitution. In Sgaglione v. Levitt, 37 NY2d 507 (1975) the legislature attempted to require then Comptroller Author Levitt to\npurchase $125,000,000 in the Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York (MAC bonds). This organization\nchallenged that statute as a violation of Article V, Section 7. In upholding the PCNY’s challenge of the statute in question, the\n\ncourt stated as follows:\n\n~...it is nevertheless concluded that the legislature is powerless in the face of the\nconstitutional non-impairment clause to mandate that he [the Comptroller] mindlessly\ninvest in whatever securities they direct, good, indifferent, or bad. The ultimate difference\nis between authority to invest and a mandatory direction to invest in certain securities and\nin certain minimum amounts, whether or not the State Comptroller deems it advisable.”\n\nThe legislature next attempted to direct the Comptroller in his management of the funds of the Retirement Systems in McDermott\nv. Regan, 82 NY2d 354 (1993). This organization, among others, brought legal challenge to Chapter 210 of the Laws of 1990\nwhich would have required the Comptroller to change the funding method for the New York State Retirement Systems from an\nAggregate Cost (AC) method to a Projected Unit Credit (PUC) method on the grounds that it violated Article V, Section 7 of the\nNew York State Constitution by diminishing or impairing the benefits of membership in the New York State Pension System. The\ncourt agreed, citing Sgaglione v. Levitt in support of its decision and struck down Section 210 of the Laws of 1990.\n\nThis bill suffers from the same legal infirmities that resulted in the Court’s striking down the MAC legislation in Sgaglione v.\nLevitt and the PUC legislation in McDermott v. Regan and should therefore be disapproved. If this legislation should become\nlaw, then this organization will immediately file suit to defend the autonomy and independence of the New York State\n\nComptroller as it did in Sgaglione v.

This proposal would amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to banning the acceptance of high volume hydraulic fracturing wastewater from oil or natural gas extraction at wastewater treatment facilities and solid waste management facilities. During the high volume hydraulic fracturing process chemicals are used in the drilling mud, slurries and fluids required for fracking. Every drilled well produces millions of gallons of toxic waste fluid containing the added chemicals, as well as other naturally occurring radioactive material, liquid hydrocarbons, brine water and heavy metals.1 Well drilling companies end up with large quantities of waste in the form of flow back fluid, brine solids, and leachates. These waste products pose a significant public and environmental health risk if they end up in waterways or aquifers as a result of disposal or use on roadways.\nIn March 2018 the Concerned Health Professionals of New York released a report The Compendium of Scientific, Medical, and Media Findings Demonstrating Risks and Harms of Fracking (the Compendium), which is a fully referenced compilation of the evidence outlining the risks and harms of fracking.2 The Compendium collected and compiled findings from three sources including, articles from peer-reviewed medical or scientific journals; investigative reports by journalists; and reports from, or commissioned by, government agencies.\n"Substantial evidence shows that drilling and fracking activities, and associated wastewater disposal practices, inherently threaten groundwater and have polluted drinking water sources, as confirmed by the 2016 final report of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the impacts of fracking on the nation\'s drinking water.... of the more than 1,000 chemicals that are confirmed ingredients in fracking fluid, an estimated 100 are known endocrine disruptors, acting as reproductive and developmental toxicants. Adding to this mix are heavy metals, radioactive elements, brine, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which occur naturally in deep geological formations and which can be carried up from the fracking zone with the flowback fluid."3\nCurrently, New York State allows waste from hydraulic fracturing to be shipped to New York for ADK | 301 Hamilton Street | Albany, NY 12210-1707 | 518-449-3870 | ADK.org',

By giving landlords the ability to increase their rent by 20% per year they are able to rapidly increase the rate above $2,700 per month, deregulating the apartment. This system creates a significant incentive for the owners of these buildings to use any means, including tenant harassment and other predatory practices, to push tenants to leave their regulated apartments. Even if a tenant is forced to leave their apartment due to significant issues such as lack of heat, water, or electricity that make it uninhabitable, their landlord is still eligible for the statutory vacancy bonus. Repealing this bonus will remove a significant financial incentive to harass tenants and provide them with an unlivable apartment. This legislation would represent a major step forward in New York's continued efforts to protect the rights of tenants throughout the State.\nFor these reasons, I support this legislation and strongly encourage its passage.\nRespectfully Submitted,\nGeorge Latimer\nWestchester County Executive\nOffice of the County Executive\nMichaelian Office Building 148 Martine Avenue White Plains, New York 10601\nEmail: ce@westchestergov.com Telephone: (914)995-2900\nwestchestergov.com",

Since 2017, in New York City and other parts of the state, ICE agents have been spotted routinely lurking the hallways of state courthouses and arresting people attending their court dates. These tactics undermine the state\'s court system and threaten due process and the administration of justice.\nThe NYCLU supports the Protect Our Courts Act as a means of ensuring that New Yorkers\' access to the courts is not compromised by this misguided approach to immigration enforcement. 2018\nICE\'s courthouse enforcement tactics threaten New Yorkers\' constitutional right to access the courts.\nThe ability to access the state court system is essential to our notions of liberty and due process. The right to sue and defend in the courts is "the right conservative of all other rights, and lies at the foundation of orderly government."1 Preserving that right requires that the government do more than merely open the courthouse doors. The government must remove barriers that prevent certain classes of persons from availing themselves of the courts, lest their right to court access be effectively foreclosed.2 The Supreme Court has required state authorities to take affirmative steps to ensure that the right of court access is realized.3\n1 Chambers v.

This bill would eliminate a major source of drinking water contamination and encourage the adoption of PFAS-free alternatives.\nThe danger that PFAS chemicals pose to human health is well-known. Recent studies, including one from March 2019, have shown that PFAS chemicals are associated with detrimental health effects such as cancer, hormone disruption, liver and kidney damage, developmental and reproductive harm, and immune system toxicity. There is likely no safe level of exposure to these chemicals for our most vulnerable populations.\nPFOS, one chemical in the PFAS class, has been widely used in class-B firefighting foam designed to fight flammable liquid fires. Because substitutes created to replace PFOS, such as GenX, pose similar toxicological dangers, banning the whole class of PFAS chemicals in firefighting foam is necessary.\nMultiple water contamination events in New York have been caused by PFAS firefighting foam, which easily seeps into lakes, rivers, and groundwater. Newburgh's drinking water was polluted by firefighting foam containing PFOS, used and stored at Stewart Air National Guard Base. Recently, PFAS firefighting foam spilled into Silver Stream in Newburgh, which flows to the Moodna Creek and Hudson River. Earlier this year, the Hampton Bays Fire Department on Long Island was designated a state Superfund site due to groundwater contamination by PFAS foam. Washington State has already passed a ban on PFAS chemicals in firefighting foam, and state legislatures in Virginia, Kentucky and Georgia have passed similar bans. PFAS-free foams are readily available on the market. Airports in London, Copenhagen, and across Australia (as well as the armed forces of Denmark and Norway) have all made the switch. It's time for New York to ban these toxic chemicals in firefighting foam.\nSummary\nThis bill amends the executive law by banning the use, manufacture, sale, and distribution of firefighting foam containing intentionally added PFAS chemicals two years after the effective date, and for training purposes immediately after the effective date.\nEnvironmental Advocates of New York strongly supports this bill.\n353 Hamilton Street, Albany, New York 12210 Tel 518.462.5526 Fax 518.427.0381 www.eany.org Printed on 100% post-consumer recycled paper.\nMemo #37",

GMHC has served LGBTQ individuals since it’s founding, including those who have loyally served in the military. This has not been without great difficulty. Before the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” in 2011, approximately! 14,000 military members were discharged due to their sexual orientation. Despite the repeal of this policy, the process for a veteran to have this status removed can take up to 18 months for this to occur. This has caused serious financial, mental health and physiological burden to LGBTQ veterans who have been unable to receive support after being discharged due to their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression. According to a “review of state laws by Senator Brad Hoylman’s office, more than 50 state programs, benefits and tax breaks for veterans are dependent upon their discharge status.” The homophobic policy of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell cost many veterans in New York government jobs, healthcare services through Veteran Affairs, property tax breaks, and several other necessary support programs or services. No veteran should serve their country only to then be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression.

A This memorandum in opposition is written on behalf of our client, the New York 5 Bankers Association (NYBA). NYBA is comprised of community, regional, and large banks across every region of New York State. Together NYBA members employ nearly 200,000 New Yorkers, safeguard $2 trillion in deposits, and extend nearly $70 billion in home and small business loans. This legislation would limit the designation of a banking development district (“BDD”) to fourteen years (while allowing additional approved extensions for five or ten year increments) and would expand the program to allow federal and state chartered credit unions to participate in BDDs. The purpose of the bill is stated to “expand access to banking services in communities where there is a demonstrated need for additional products and services.” However, NYBA believes the legislation will achieve the opposite, thus discouraging participation in the BDD program overall. The BDD Program was established in 1997 to provide incentives for banks and thrift institutions to establish branches in areas of the State that were considered underserved by traditional banking offices. These incentives may include State and local deposits with reduced rates of interest. One of the reasons the Program is successful is because it encourages banks and thrifts to establish branches in BDDs without the use of punitive measures. This legislation, however, would discourage banks and thrifts to establish BDDs by requiring that applications for BDDs be re-approved at different and unpredictable time intervals. No other type of branch application must be resubmitted and reapproved. In addition, the costs of security, accessibility, capital, personnel and other expenses for a new bank branch often run into the millions of dollars, particularly in such high-cost areas of the State as New York City. It is doubtful that financial institutions will be willing to commit the very significant capital costs, planning efforts, coordination with local governmental bodies, and operating expenses to establish a branch when the possibility exists that the branch may not be approved to continue after some number of years.

Unfortunately, school districts across New York State rely heavily on exclusionary punishment to respond to student behavior. New York’s current laws favor harsh punishments, including mandatory suspensions and suspensions that can last for an entire school year. The result is that vulnerable student populations, including students of color, students with disabilities, and LGBTQI students are pushed out of the classroom and often into the web of court involvement. The Solutions Not Suspensions Act would address this issue by encouraging schools to use education-based, age appropriate, proven alternatives to suspensions. These alternatives improve school climate, strengthen student-teacher relationships, and correct misbehavior over the long run. This will drastically reduce the use of out of school punishments to respond to minor, non-dangerous misbehavior. This bill will also limit the maximum length of suspensions, restrict suspensions of students in Pre-K through third grade, and formalize processes to ensure that students who are suspended are able to stay on track academically. These reforms are meant to address the appalling racial disparities in suspensions, which are exacerbated at the extreme ends of the discipline spectrum: extremely long suspensions, suspensions of the youngest students, and suspensions for the most minor misbehavior. The NYCLU strongly supports S.767, the Solutions Not Suspensions Act, and urges lawmakers to pass it promptly. 1"',

No Same As Explanation This legislation requires lead in drinking water testing and remediation at a limited number of child day care facilities in New York. With young children at highest risk of life-long damage from this neurotoxin, New York must take steps to ensure day care facilities are lead-free spaces. There is no safe level of lead in drinking water. The growing bodies and developing organs of children are especially vulnerable to lead exposure. Even low levels of lead in children can cause neurological damage, impaired hearing, slowed growth, and anemia. This legislation builds on New York’s nation-leading efforts to reduce lead in drinking water. In 2016, the Legislature required public schools to regularly test their tap water for lead and take action if elevated levels were discovered. A 2018 analysis of the statewide testing data revealed the shocking prevalence of lead in drinking water: around 82% of school buildings reported one or more taps that tested above the state lead action level (15 parts per billion). It is time to expand protections against lead in drinking water to day care facilities statewide, where young children can spend a large proportion of their time. It is essential that New York guarantees these children clean and safe drinking water. New York City and nine other states already require lead testing at certain day care facilities. We recommend expanding this legislation to all day care facilities licensed or registered with the Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS). The legislation currently only applies to child day care centers, while excluding home-based care such as group family day care homes and family day care homes. Recent data from OCFS indicates that 12,099 home-based facilities, with the capacity to serve 154,774 children, would not be covered by this legislation. All children in day care should have the same drinking water protections, regardless of the type of facility they are placed in.

This legislation would amend the Executive Law and the Penal Law in relation to the revocation of community supervision. The bill, known as “less is more,” dramatically changes the current law as it relates to community supervision. As written, the bill would make it virtually impossible for parole officers to do their jobs. The proposal removes all meaningful consequences for bad actors, ties the hands of parole officers and makes it much harder for them to help parolees transition back into society. With the number of violent crimes on law enforcement personnel on the rise, the timing of this proposal could not be worse. The legislation relies on the faulty premise that our jails and prisons are full of parolees sent back by overzealous parole officers because they were fifteen minutes late for curfew. In fact, less than 2 percent of the inmates at Rikers Island are true technical parole violators. The other 18 percent of the population considered parole violators are obsconders, who are actually fugitives whose whereabouts had previously been unknown. The bill sponsors wrongfully assume that parole officers’ principle goal is to lock people up instead of focusing on all of the things that they do to help parolees safely reintegrate back into the community. The bill takes the fundamental terms and conditions of parole, which is essentially a contract between the parole officer and the parolee with expectations, rules and consequences, and wipes out the consequences. As written, parole officers no longer have the ability to re-incarcerate parolees for violating essentially any of the terms and conditions of their release. The bill language makes it virtually impossible to incarcerate (over)"',

 ('"SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE - April 30, 2019 ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCATES OF NEW YORK Key to Legislative Ratings: 444 Major Benefit $4 Substantial Benefit 4 Beneficial Enhancing Access to Public Transit S.1015 (Comrie) A.3905 (Hyndman, et al.) Explanation The transportation sector is the largest source of climate pollution in New York, representing 34- percent of the state’s greenhouse gas portfolio. Air pollution emitted from tailpipes is a major contributor to smog and poor air quality, which is a direct threat to the health and welfare of New Yorkers. Enhancing access to public transportation systems that are safe, reliable, and robust is critical if New York is to make progress at reducing transportation pollution. Public transit in the New York City metropolitan region is in a state of crisis. While lawmakers took a significant step towards addressing the crisis by authorizing congestion pricing and establishing a dedicated funding stream for the modernization of transit systems run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), there are additional measures that can be implemented to provide New Yorkers with immediate relief. Equalizing fares for travel on commuter rail lines operated by the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North within the New York City limits will expand access to public transit in 31 neighborhoods in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens served by 38 commuter rail stations. Making fares equal to a MetroCard ride and affording the option for free transfers between commuter trains, subways, and buses will remove a significant cost barrier for approximately 1.4 million New York City residents, there-by making public transit a more viable and cost-effective alternative to driving. Summary This bill amends the Public Authorities Law to require the MTA to allow riders traveling within the limits of New York City to pay fares equal to that of a MetroCard fare when utilizing commuter rail service.

 ('"———"" NEW YORK STATE BUILDERS ASSOCIATION, INC Lewis Dubuque | Executive Vice President N Y S B A Eric Willson | President “Storm Chaser” Legislation S.1405 (Carlucci) A.7531 (Buttenschon) MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION This memorandum is submitted in opposition of the subject bill, which focuses on preventing a roofing contractor from using insurance proceeds as an inducement, either directly or through advertisement, to motivate a customer to enter into a contract to repair damage potentially covered by insurance. A simpler approach would be to explicitly prohibit a roofing contractor from entering into a contract contingent on the receipt of insurance proceeds by the customer. Based on the uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of payment it is not productive for either the customer or the contractor to predicate the transaction on future receipt of funds which may not materialize. This approach is equivalent to contracting for home construction and starting work before there is a commitment for a construction loan from the lending institution as to the amount and payment of the same. This approach would eliminate the necessity for the cancellation provision, which permits the customer to nullify the contract if the insurance proceeds are not forthcoming. This provision is not positive for the consumer because even if the contract ends the residence may be in a state of semi-repair where the work was started. The contractor risks both loss of payment for the work undertaken as it applies to both labor and materials. The homeowner has a cancelled contract, where the job is undone. We believe that a consumer should not contract for a project where there are not sufficient funds available to the consumer to pay for the project. The contractor should not be using contingent insurance funding as an inducement to undertake a project which is not otherwise financially feasible. This approach indicates, in many cases, that the contractor is not interested in completion of the work and that a potential scam is being initiated. Most other provisions in the bill are unnecessary because they are either dealt with in the contract or pursuant to the current Home Improvement Contract Law, which is applicable to the roofing contractors. The Home Improvement Contract law provides two pathways for contractors to perform - on a time and materials basis or progress payments. The statute requires progress payments to show the amount of payments and identify the state of completion when the payment is due. The contractor is required to place funds in an escrow account or other prescribed method to protect the consumer\'s funds. This bill provides that the contractor cannot require a deposit of more than half of the agreed-upon consideration. This provision is at variance with the Home Improvement Contract law, which requires the 152 Washington Avenue | Lower Level | Albany, New York 12210 | 518.465.2492 | 518.465.0635 fax | Email: info@nysba.com | Website: www.nysba.com"',
